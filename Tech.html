During the end of development, I was assigned the role of tester after Elise required us to undergo automated testing.
I began right away researching and looking for a tool that would best work for our site. The tool had to be free, it had to be cross platform and it needed to be able to automate and increment data input. I ended up choosing Selenium because it was the best fit for the required task.

The first test that I used to test Selenium was automating data input in the login screen. I had selenium run a script that would randomly enter data into the username and login boxes. This was not an attempt to test the site against a brute force attack but rather to see if random information could be generated and entered into a site with selenium.
After It was decided that selenium would be the main tool to be used in testing I began testing key features of the site, such as creating leave requests, accepting and rejecting them. Mainly my goal was to test what would happen when obscure values were entered into the site and record how the site would handle it. Tests were done on both the live and development versions.

Towards the end of my testing I required help from Fletcher because of an issue I was having with selenium and how it interacted with the date selection section of the site. Up until this point I had been changing the value that selenium would enter each time the test would run. But with fletchers help we were able to automate this process. While testing on the final day, Fletcher and I discovered that the login page was broken. This was the only major bug that we could find in the site that Nick and Albert had missed.

    Below are a number of screenshots showing selenium setup to run a number of tests that cover the majority of features within the application.
