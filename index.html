Duing This semester in software engineering we built a student leave application that is designed to manage student leave as the name implies.
</p>
<p class="contentP">
The application is built around the idea of making a lectures job easy when managing student leave. We were provided with many user stories from a number of lectures, mainly Elise and Martin.
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p class="contentP">
The class was structured in a way that was very different to anything that I had experienced before at the polytechnic. We were not told how to get things done or how to build what was asked; in fact, we were left to ourselves in that regard. We had to learn how to create applications based on the user stories provided to us.
</p>
<p class="contentP">
The ability to work independent from a teacher and figure things out ourselves was what was being taught to us. It was expressed many times during the course that at this point in the BIT we should be able to work independently and without instruction.
</p>
<p class="contentP">
To be completely honest at first, I did not like this idea; I felt that I was being cheated out of an education, that my money was going to waste. However somewhere towards the end of project one I began to understand why we were being taught in the manner that we were. Obviously, we were being taught so that we would be competitive in the job market. Who would hire somebody that they must manage 24/7? Nobody… obviously. As the course progressed it became more and more obvious that the skills we were learning we the most valuable that we had learned so far in the BIT, and would likely be the most important thorough our career; the ability to would independently, with the application of agile principles.
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p class="contentP">
Throughout the first half of the course the agile principles were expressed to us and their application was made understood.
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p class="contentP">
Through practice we understood that our highest priority was to the customer. Through the customer we were provided with user stories, which we built the application around. User stories would be added raguly, often after having just completed the last set. At times the customer requested things that seemed unreasonable, fortunately given the nature of development we would be able find a compromised solution that would likely work better in the product.

The practice of using agile principles in the development however is not the most important leasson that we have learned from this course. In my opinion the ability to work independently far exceeds that application of the agile principles in terms of real world value and use. You might say “How exactly did you learn to work independently? That seems like something that can’t be taught”, and you would be right to some extent. We didn’t exactly learn to work independently but rather we learned skills that enabled us to work independently successfully. “Ok, so what are these skills and how did you learn them”, you might ask; well its simple really. We learned how to learn. A good example of this would be one of the tasks that we were given during the second half of the semester. We were tasked with installing jekyl and deploying a website with it. The previous sentence is in face all the instruction that was given; “I want you to install jekyl and use it to deploy a site, then I want you to deploy a site from git-pages”. Prior to instruction, very little people in the class had ever heard of jekyl. We had to learn how to install a piece of software that was completely alien to us and use it to complete a task, without any help from lectures. The only way to complete this task was to go online and learn from online tutorials that were either outdated, earliest or incomplete. Through this process we learned that we have the ability to learn.
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p class="contentP">
The week following our instillation of jekyl we would be tested on our ability to learn. We were tasked with creating a web application that would display the location of earth quakes. Prior to this test, the majority of the class had very little experience using the technology’s that we were tested on. However most of us were able to make a good effort.

During the test I found that time management was the most important key to success. I did not anticipate this. In the test we were given a number of tasks to complete in a relatively short amount of time. If I were to spend a hole load of time attempting to complete a task that I was having difficulty with, I would have missed out on other marks given to other areas of the test. This concept of time management could be applied to the entire project in my opinion.
</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p class="contentP">
At the beginning and towards the end of the project my ability to learn was tested. I had to learn to understand and read PhP, a language that I had very little experience with before, and I had to learn how to test the application that was being built with a piece of software called Selenium. I will talk more about the technical side of selenium later, but for now know that I had to find a program that could automate tests and record results so that my group could identify where things were not working as they should.

One very important area in which I lacked at times was team communication. Ortho I stayed in communication through the project with my class mates in person, I did not get involved in the conversation that took place in the slack channel to the extent that I should have. In hind sight this may have been a burden on some of my team members as when they wanted to get in touch with me during the day they would often have to seek me out in person. This does not mean however that I was completely absent from group communication. I would often use Facebook and other means of communication to get in touch with group members directly as they too would not always be online in the slack channel, which I would check regularly. It seems however that regularly was not regularly enough, and that I should have had slack open whenever I was at a computer. When I did use slack to communicate it was often to inform the group of events that would affect everybody. For example, when I learned that we would have two members of the software testing class test our software I used Slack to let the rest of the group know.
